The entry class is ProcessTransactions, which has a main method to process the transactions. 

This method imports the given input files (stored in the resources folder), processes the transactions and outputs the data to the given OMS output files: output.aaa, output.bbb and output.ccc for AAA, BBB and CCC respectively. Within the IDE, these will be written to the classes folder, but this can easily be adjusted in the main method.
